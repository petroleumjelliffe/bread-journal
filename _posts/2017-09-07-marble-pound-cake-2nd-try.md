title: Marble Pund Cake - Second try

---

## Summary

Second attempt at my mom's marble xpound cake recipe.  She uses 250 ml of milk and more flour, but I'm adjsuting it to follow the 1:1:1:1 ratio for pound cake you find in cookbooks.  Equal weights flour, sugar, fat (butter) and egg.

Last time, I rushed a bit and forgot a few things:
* I forgot to add the liquid there was way more flour than there should have been.  
* The butter was  straight out of the fridge, so this time I left it out for an hour to hit room temp.  
* I also used the paddle attachment instead of the whisk.  _HUGE_ improvement.
* The cocoa part of the cake tasted best, but I decided to "bloom" it this time after reading about that in a brownie recipe.

## Ingredients
* Butter - 2 sticks or 225 g
* Sugar - 225 g
* Flour - 225g
* Egg - 4 jumbo eggs or 225 g 
* Baking podwer - 1 tsp
* Cocoa powder - 2 tsp
* Hot coffee (for bloomingthe cocoa) - 1 tbsp

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 375ยบ (or 350ยบ convection oven)
* Leave the butter out for 60 minutes to reach room temp.  Toss in the standing mixer with the paddle attachment.
* Mix for 2-3 minutes, pouring in the sugar.
* After 2 minutes, crack in each egg one at a time.
* Then start pouring in the flour, and the baking powder.  
* In a separate dish, combine the cocoa and the coffee.  It'll make a thick syrup-like consistency.
* Take about half of the batter our of the stand mixer, and place in a separate bowl.  Ingredients totaled about 900 g, so 450 g about.
* Add 2 tsp vanilla extract to the mixer and combine.
* Add the vanilla batter to the pan.
* Return the other half of the batter to the mixer and combine with the bloomed cocoa.  
* Add the chocolate batter to the pan.
* Swirl the batters.  I twirled my spatula in a coarse motion between both batters.
